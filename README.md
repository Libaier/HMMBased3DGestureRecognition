HMMBasedGestureRecognition-3D
==========================

An implementation of the HMM-based threshold model approach for gesture recognition proposed by HK Lee (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=799904)

The HMM part of the project is implement by Accord .NET Framework(http://accord-framework.net/)

It's 3D gesture recognition.The data is collect by Optitrack and Motive(http://www.naturalpoint.com/optitrack/)
